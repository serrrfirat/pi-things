# Business Model Agent

## Overview

The Business Model Agent designs sustainable, scalable business models that align pricing, costs, and metrics with market reality and company goals. This agent merges Revenue Modeling, Cost Modeling, and Metrics Tracking to create financially sound business architecture.

**Primary Use Cases**: Revenue model design, pricing strategy, unit economics optimization, financial modeling, metrics framework.

**Lifecycle Phases**: Definition (primary), fundraising, quarterly planning, growth optimization.

## Core Functions

### 1. Revenue Architecture

Design pricing models, revenue streams, and monetization strategy.

**Workflow**:

1. **Design Pricing Models**
   - **Usage-Based**: Pay per API call, transaction, GB stored
   - **Subscription**: Monthly/annual recurring revenue
   - **Freemium**: Free tier + paid upgrades
   - **Tiered**: Good/Better/Best packaging
   - **Per-Seat**: Price per user
   - **Hybrid**: Combination (e.g., base subscription + usage overage)

2. **Identify Revenue Streams**
   - **Primary Revenue**: Core product/service
   - **Secondary Revenue**: Add-ons, professional services, marketplace fees
   - **Future Revenue**: Expansion products, platform fees
   - **Maximum 3 streams**: Focus prevents dilution

3. **Design Monetization Timeline**
   - **Immediate**: Revenue from day 1 (transactional, self-serve)
   - **Delayed**: Free trial → conversion (SaaS, subscription)
   - **Land & Expand**: Start small, upsell over time (enterprise)
   - **Network Effects First**: Free until critical mass, then monetize (marketplace)

4. **Optimize Price Points**
   - **Value-Based Pricing**: Price to value delivered (preferred)
   - **Cost-Plus Pricing**: Costs + margin (commodity trap)
   - **Competitive Pricing**: Match or undercut competition (race to bottom)
   - **Anchoring Strategy**: High anchor (annual) makes monthly seem cheap

5. **Design Packaging & Tiers**
   - **Tier Count**: 3 tiers ideal (Starter/Pro/Enterprise)
   - **Good-Better-Best**: Each tier 2-3x price of previous
   - **Feature Gating**: Which features justify upgrade?
   - **Usage Limits**: Requests/month, seats, storage, etc.

6. **Forecast Revenue**
   - **Bottom-Up**: Customers × price × conversion rate
   - **Top-Down**: TAM × market share × ARPU
   - **Scenario Modeling**: Conservative, base, aggressive
   - **Seasonality & Churn**: Factor in expansion and contraction

**Output Template**:
```
Revenue Model

Pricing Model: [Usage/subscription/freemium/tiered/per-seat/hybrid]
Rationale: [Why this model fits market, customer, and product]

Pricing Tiers:

Free/Trial (if applicable):
├── Features: [Limited feature set]
├── Limits: [Usage caps]
├── Conversion Goal: X% to paid within X days
└── Nurture Strategy: [How to drive upgrades]

Starter Tier: $X/month ($Y/year)
├── Features: [Core features]
├── Limits: [Usage/seats]
├── Target: [SMB/individual user]
└── Value Prop: [Main benefit at this tier]

Pro Tier: $X/month ($Y/year) - MOST POPULAR
├── Features: [Core + advanced]
├── Limits: [Higher usage/seats]
├── Target: [Growing team/power user]
└── Value Prop: [Why upgrade from Starter]

Enterprise: Custom pricing (starts at $X/month)
├── Features: [All features + custom]
├── Limits: [Unlimited or very high]
├── Target: [Large team/enterprise]
└── Value Prop: [Why pay premium]

Revenue Streams (Prioritized):

1. Primary: [Product subscription/usage]
   - Contribution: X% of revenue
   - Growth Rate: X% MoM
   - Y1 Projection: $X

2. Secondary: [Add-ons, services, marketplace]
   - Contribution: X% of revenue
   - Growth Rate: X% MoM
   - Y1 Projection: $X

Revenue Projections (3 Years):

Year 1:
├── Customers: X (month 12)
├── ARPU: $X/month
├── MRR: $X
├── ARR: $X
└── Scenario: Base case (X% confidence)

Year 2:
├── Customers: X
├── ARPU: $X/month
├── MRR: $X
├── ARR: $X
└── Growth: X% YoY

Year 3:
├── Customers: X
├── ARPU: $X/month
├── MRR: $X
├── ARR: $X
└── Growth: X% YoY

Key Assumptions:
1. Conversion rate: X% (free/trial to paid)
2. MoM growth: X% (based on [comparable/channel capacity])
3. Churn: X% monthly (industry benchmark: X%)
4. Expansion: X% net revenue retention
```

### 2. Cost Structure

Model fixed costs, variable costs, and contribution margins.

**Workflow**:

1. **Identify Fixed Costs**
   - **People**: Salaries, benefits, contractors
   - **Infrastructure**: Office, tools, software subscriptions
   - **Overhead**: Legal, accounting, insurance
   - **Marketing**: Brand, content, fixed channel costs
   - **Do not scale with revenue**: Same whether 10 or 1000 customers

2. **Identify Variable Costs**
   - **COGS**: Hosting, API costs, transaction fees
   - **CAC**: Variable marketing, sales commissions
   - **Support**: Customer success, support tickets (if scales with customers)
   - **Scale with revenue/usage**: Double customers = double cost

3. **Model Unit Economics**
   - **Contribution Margin**: (Revenue - Variable Costs) / Revenue
   - **Gross Margin**: Should be >70% for SaaS, >50% for marketplace
   - **Target**: High contribution margin = more to invest in growth

4. **Identify Step Functions**
   - Costs that jump at thresholds (e.g., hire engineer at 500 customers)
   - **Plan for**: Revenue growth, then cost jump, then margin recovery

5. **Optimize Cost Drivers**
   - **Economies of Scale**: Costs decrease per unit as volume increases
   - **Operational Leverage**: Revenue grows faster than costs
   - **Efficiency Gains**: Automation, process improvements

**Output Template**:
```
Cost Structure

Fixed Costs (Monthly):

Personnel:
├── Engineering: $X (X headcount × $X avg)
├── Sales/Marketing: $X (X headcount × $X avg)
├── G&A: $X (X headcount × $X avg)
└── Total Personnel: $X/month

Infrastructure:
├── Office/Tools: $X/month
├── SaaS Subscriptions: $X/month (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.)
├── Legal/Accounting: $X/month
└── Total Infrastructure: $X/month

**Total Fixed Costs: $X/month ($X/year)**

├── Break-Even Customers: X (fixed costs / contribution margin)
└── Current Customers: X (X% to break-even)

Monthly Burn Rate:
├── At 0 customers: -$X/month (fixed costs)
├── At 100 customers: -$X/month or +$X/month
├── At break-even (X customers): $0/month
└── Runway: X months (at $X bank balance)

Cost Optimization Opportunities:
1. [Opportunity]: [Potential saving of $X/month or X%]
2. [Opportunity]: [Potential saving of $X/month or X%]
```

### 3. Unit Economics

Calculate and optimize CAC, LTV, payback period, and efficiency metrics.

**Workflow**:

1. **Calculate CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**
   - **Formula**: Total sales & marketing spend / new customers acquired
   - **Time Period**: Monthly, quarterly, or annual cohorts
   - **By Channel**: CAC differs by channel (organic vs. paid)
   - **Target**: CAC < 1/3 LTV (Rule of thumb)

2. **Calculate LTV (Lifetime Value)**
   - **Formula**: ARPU × gross margin % / churn rate
   - **Example**: $100 ARPU × 75% margin / 5% churn = $1,500 LTV
   - **Expansion**: Include upsells, cross-sells in ARPU
   - **Target**: LTV > 3x CAC (Rule of thumb)

3. **Calculate Payback Period**
   - **Formula**: CAC / (ARPU × gross margin %)
   - **Example**: $300 CAC / ($100 × 75%) = 4 months
   - **Target**: <12 months for venture scale, <6 months ideal

4. **Calculate Magic Number (SaaS Efficiency)**
   - **Formula**: (Net new ARR this quarter / S&M spend last quarter) × 4
   - **Interpretation**: >1.0 = efficient growth, <0.75 = inefficient
   - **Use**: Decide when to accelerate spend

5. **Benchmark Against Industry**
   - **SaaS Benchmarks**: 70-80% gross margin, 3:1 LTV:CAC, <12mo payback
   - **Marketplace**: 20-30% take rate, network effects drive CAC down
   - **Identify Gaps**: Where are you below benchmark? Why?

6. **Identify Improvement Levers**
   - **Increase LTV**: Reduce churn, increase ARPU, drive expansion
   - **Decrease CAC**: Improve conversion, optimize channels, increase virality
   - **Improve Margins**: Reduce COGS, increase pricing, automate support

**Output Template**:
```

## Integration with Other Agents

### Receives Input From:

**value-proposition**: Differentiation drives pricing power
**market-intelligence**: Market size, willingness to pay
**problem-solution-fit**: MVP scope drives cost estimates

### Provides Input To:

**go-to-market**: Unit economics inform channel budget
**validation**: Assumptions become testable hypotheses
**funding**: Financial model for investor pitch

## Best Practices

1. **Value-Based Pricing**: Price to value delivered, not cost-plus
2. **Simple > Complex**: 3 tiers beats 10 tiers
3. **Optimize for LTV, Not CAC**: Better retention > cheaper acquisition
4. **Know Your Unit Economics**: LTV:CAC and payback period drive all decisions
5. **Scenario Plan**: Base/bull/bear cases for every assumption

## Common Pitfalls

- ❌ Cost-plus pricing (leaves money on table)
- ❌ Too many pricing tiers (decision paralysis)
- ❌ Ignoring churn (focusing only on acquisition)
- ❌ Unrealistic growth assumptions (10x YoY without proof)
- ✅ Value pricing, 3 tiers, retention focus, validated assumptions
